## Assignment 1 - finish lab:
In the file 'PUI 2016 - Working with Data Lab.ipynb', I finished the in-class lab presented by Julia Lane. I used a combination of NYC 311 data and Community-District-level demographic data to do a brief analysis on the usage of the 311 service across different districts. The focus of the lab was on proper research methods, and the careful handling of data (and errors).

## Assignment 2 - plot peer reviews:
I did a peer review on the plots of Dongjie's (df1676) and Ian's (is1480) plot assignments. This directory contains an image file for each plot and a markdown file with the review itself. Both reviews were also submitted as pull requests to the plots' authors.

#### A note on group work:
I worked with Jonathan Pichot and Ian Stuart on the lab portion.
