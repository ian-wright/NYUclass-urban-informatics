Clarity: As the title implies the plot supposed to visualize sugar content in 77 popular breakfast cereals where X-axis is sugar per 
serving in grams and Y-axis is count of cereals. The plot has attributes such as title, axes description, and good(one) color scheme 
readability. In my opinion, it's confusing how to read this plot. For example, value 2 and 3 on x-axis correlates to value 16 on y-axis. 
Does it mean that in 16 cereals there 2 or 3 grams of sugar? In my understanding, as per title interpretation, the plot should show 77 
breakfast cereals and content of sugar in grams for each.

Esthetic: Color scheme is readable. Graphic element(histogram) is appropriate to represent the quantities, but choosen interpretation of
quantities is not clear.

Honesty: The plot doesn't reproduce the data correctly.

Suggestion: from the same data set choose top 10 cereals(or use original 77) ['names'] and sugar content for them ['sugars']. 
assign ['names'] to x-axis and assign ['sugars'] to y-axis. if it's hard to fit names of cereals to x-axis then assign color for each 
cereals and attache a legend to the plot. Change title of the plot and captions of x and y axis.
I don't see any reason to use 'plt.subplots()' in the code. I saved the plot as png (prints creen) for this review.
