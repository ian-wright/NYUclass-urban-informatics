## Assignment 1
In 'hw9_assign1' I use NYC MTA turnstile data to practice the detection of major events, persistent trends, and periodicity. A range of methods were used: the event detection uses a 3-sigma outlier approach, the trend-finding uses data smoothing and linear regression, and finally the periodicity analysis uses a Fourier transform and associated power analysis for various frequencies.

#### A note on group work:
I consulted and shared approaches with Ian Stuart and Jordan Vani on this assignment.
