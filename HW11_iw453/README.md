## Assignment 1
In 'hw11_assign1' I do a quick geo-spatial exercise in finding which census block CUSP falls into, and plotting this on a map of the city.


## Assignment 2
In 'hw101_assign2', I pull together government census data on the number of business establishments in each NYC zip code area, over time (1994 - 2014). After some munging and cleaning, I do a clustering analysis on the TIME SERIES data for each zip code, with the intent of grouping together zip codes that have seen similar temporal dynamics in business activity since 1994. 

I compare two different clustering methods, and make some general conclusions about these two methods, and about the overall output of the analysis.


#### A note on group work:
Worked with Jonathan Pichot and Kristi Korsberg on assignment 2.
