## Assignment 1:
I downloaded building energy data from NYC's open portal (based on local law 84 energy disclosure rules). After cleaning and munging the data, I performed a series of regression analyses on two dimensions of the dataset: the number of units in a building, and the total energy usage. I experimented with different axis configurations, log-scales, and models until a good fit was found. I used a chi-sqaure goodness-of-fit test, and a liklihood ratio test to test the models.

## Assignment 2:
Jonathan Pichot and I worked together to finish the citibike analysis project started in homework 3. We used a statistical test to validate the difference in citibike demand between a "boundary zone" and "non-boundary" zone in Manhattan. Based on the result, we concluded that there is indeed heightened demand for citibike zone expansion towards North Manhattan / Harlem / Columbia University. All of the project's setup, method, results, and discussion were summarized in a report here: https://www.authorea.com/users/105832/articles/133635/_show_article?access_token=ktrvfA4GnzJFJR0Jf6juwQ

#### A note on group work:
I worked with Jonathan Pichot on both assignments. I also received some help with the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test from 
# FBB excellent work
goo that you clarified  the boundary stations choice
